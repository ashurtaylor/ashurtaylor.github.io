<h2> stretch</h2>

<p> I feel my stretch is organization. Even though I dont have much time to organize my stuff I still feel I could do a better job so I can better understand everything that is happening for homework among other things. I usually just throw things in my binder or bag so I can get to the next class but I feel like I would be more prepared if I spent time to organize my stuff.</p>
