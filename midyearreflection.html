    <h2> MID YEAR REFLECTION</h2>
    
    <ol>
    <li>my friend group is very broad and I try to get along with everyone because it can never hurt to have too many friends, and I feel me and my friends are very inclusive if other people want to hang out. I have tried to make the social atmosphere better by trying to make connections with everybody.</li>
    <li>This year i participated in Open Mic Night and wanted to perform as a dancer but unfortunately i sprained my ankle so i couldnt but i still wanted to go so I performed as a part of the eigth grade choir. At my dance studio we have a buddy program and i feel I have been a role model to her. I have grown because now i understand how important it is to be there for people who look up to you. </li>
    <li>I am mostly consistent with getting work in on time unless something unexpected happens and my ability to go in during free periods and talk to teachers helps me.</li>
    </ol>
