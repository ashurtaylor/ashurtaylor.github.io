<h2>STRENGTH</h2>

<p>I feel that a strength of mine that has really helped me this year is reading compreension. because of this skill i have been able to better understand any books or sources we have to read.
  Specifically I have been better able to understand the Odyssey and the subtle clues within it. This has helped in making my work easier because I dont have to spend as long trying to understand what I read. </p>
